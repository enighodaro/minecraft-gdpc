## Project Setup / Installation:

* Download the directory "2023-04-21 - Final Project/minecraft" if you do not have GDPC on your computer.
* Alternatively if you have GDPC on your computer already you can download just the file "cs4303POS.py" for the directory mentioned above and place it into a directory with GDPC.
* Next make sure you have a Minecraft forge 1.16.5 with "gdmchttp-0.4.1" installed.
* Next you can load up a minecraft world. 
* NOTE: if this world is freshly generated you may have to exit and renter the world once or restart minecraft once if program does not run.
* NOTE: if the world is new you might want to walk/fly around a few chunks to render them in for code to generate properly.
* Now simply we will run "cs4303POS.py" while we are in a minecraft world with the game unpaused.
* This could be done by running through an IDE of your choice or through the Command Prompt by mounting the directory containing "cs4303POS.py" and a verion of GDPC and typing "Python cs4303POS.py".
* After running take a walk around the settlement and enjoy the sights!
* THAT'S ALL FOLKS!
